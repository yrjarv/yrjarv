Hi! I'm a student of Programming and System Architecture at the University of Oslo's Department of Informatics (Institutt for Informatikk, IFI).

This summer, I am working as a summer intern at [Norsk Helsenett](https://www.github.com/NorskHelsenett).

Most of my activity on GitHub is in private repositories for the courses I take at Ifi, but I have a few public repositories pinned.
